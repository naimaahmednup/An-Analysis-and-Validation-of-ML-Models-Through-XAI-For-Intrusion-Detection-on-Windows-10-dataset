#Exploring the Intersection of Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence: An Analysis and Validation of ML Models Through XAI For Intrusion Detection on Windows 10 dataset

In this paper, we present a study on the use of machine learning (ML) models for intrusion detection in Windows 10 Operating systems using the ToN-IoT dataset. We investigate the performance of different ML models including tree-based models such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in detecting these attacks. Furthermore, for the first time we use Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to understand how the attacks influence the processes in Windows 10 systems and how they can be identified and prevented. Our study highlights the importance of using XAI techniques to make ML models more interpretable and trustworthy in high-stakes applications such as intrusion detection. We believe that this work can contribute to the development of more robust and secure operating systems.

Our work shares similarities with the report published by Gad et al. in 2021 [4], where they explored the network portion of the ToN-IoT dataset. In their study, they used the Chi-square (Chi2) method for feature selection and employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance. Among the boosting algorithms tested, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy rate of over 97.9%. They also conducted an evaluation using the SMOTE technique, where both XGBoost and kNN achieved the best results with an accuracy of 99%. In contrast, for our feature selection, we utilized a built-in module in the Random Forest Classifier. 

After preprocessing the data, we resolved the class imbalance issue without the need for techniques like SMOTE. Through our experimentation, we found that KNN outperformed other models, demonstrating superior accuracy (97.22%), F1 score (97.6%), and precision. Random Forest achieved the second-best  performance, with results very close to KNN at 96.05%. Our research findings align with previous studies and contribute to a better understanding of intrusion occurrences in Windows 10, serving as a valuable foundation for future versions of both newer and older operating systems.

Going forward, we plan to further enhance the accuracy of our models by fine-tuning the parameters, aiming to achieve over 98% accuracy in future works. Once accomplished, our findings can be utilized with the help of industry experts to develop an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) based on the insights gained.
